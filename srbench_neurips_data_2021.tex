\title{Contemporary Symbolic Regression Methods and their Relative Performance}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

% \section{Submissions to the NeurIPS 2021 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks}

% Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them faithfully.

% \subsection{Style}

% Papers must be prepared according to the
% instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to {\bf nine} pages long,
% including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only acknowledgments and
% references} are allowed. Papers that exceed the page limit will not be
% reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the conference.

% Authors are required to use the NeurIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
% NeurIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the current files
% and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for
% rejection.

% \subsection{Retrieval of style files}

% The style files for the NeurIPS Track on Datasets and Benchmarks and other information are available on the World Wide Web at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!gLfRVZbnI5EEpjSs2SUEUt3REx61nOcbbaUjq8m9DBea3vF6r9tqUapXTgdh$ }
% \end{center}
% The file \verb+neurips_data_2021.pdf+ contains these instructions and illustrates the
% various formatting requirements your submission must satisfy.

% The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2021 is \verb+neurips_data_2021.sty+,
% written for \LaTeXe{}. There are no supported style sheets for Microsoft Word, RTF, or other formats. The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+, which
% creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a preprint for
% submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will not load the
% \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.

% \paragraph{Preprint option}
% If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv, using the
% NeurIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will create a version of your work with the text ``Preprint. Work in progress.''
% in the footer. This version may be distributed as you see fit. Please \textbf{do
%   not} use the \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for
% papers accepted to the NeurIPS Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.

% At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
% options. This will add line numbers to aid
% review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they
% will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies. Note that submissions to the NeurIPS Track on Datasets and Benchmarks are reviewed in a single-blind fashion and therefore not anonymous. This is because datasets can typically not be shared in a non-anonymous way. If you feel strongly that your work should be submitted anonymously, please use the \verb+anonymous+ option. This will create a version of your work with all author names hidden.

% The file \verb+neurips_data_021.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your
% paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of
% the paper with your own.

% The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
% Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.

% \section{General formatting instructions}
% \label{gen_inst}

% The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
% 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
% type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
% preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
% Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
% indentation.

% The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
% between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
% bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
% below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
% top of the page.

% Authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
% centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
% first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
% follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
% side.

% Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
% regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

% \section{Headings: first level}
% \label{headings}

% All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
% flush left, and bold.

% First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

% \subsection{Headings: second level}

% Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

% \subsubsection{Headings: third level}

% Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

% \paragraph{Paragraphs}

% There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
% bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
% of space.

% \section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
% \label{others}

% These instructions apply to everyone.

% \subsection{Citations within the text}

% The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
% author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
% format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
% used consistently.

% The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!gLfRVZbnI5EEpjSs2SUEUt3REx61nOcbbaUjq8m9DBea3vF6r9tqUWshWJ0M$ }
% \end{center}
% Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
% use in inline text.  For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
% \end{verbatim}
% produces
% \begin{quote}
%   Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
% \end{quote}

% If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
% following before loading the \verb+neurips_2021+ package:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
% \end{verbatim}

% If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
% argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2021}
% \end{verbatim}

% As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
% person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
% previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
% (e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
% citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

% \subsection{Footnotes}

% Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
% footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
% text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
% Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

% Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
% marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

% \subsection{Figures}

% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
%   \caption{Sample figure caption.}
% \end{figure}

% All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
% purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
% figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
% the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
% proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

% You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
% paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
% color.

% \subsection{Tables}

% All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
% title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
% table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
% numbered consecutively.

% Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
% strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
% typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!gLfRVZbnI5EEpjSs2SUEUt3REx61nOcbbaUjq8m9DBea3vF6r9tqUazm7Esl$ }
% \end{center}
% This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Sample table title}
%   \label{sample-table}
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{lll}
%     \toprule
%     \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%     \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%     Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%     \midrule
%     Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%     Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%     Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% \section{Final instructions}

% Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
% particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
% fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
% \textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
% numbered.

% \section{Preparing PDF files}

% Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
% example, ``A4.''

% Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
% contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
% achieve this.

% \begin{itemize}

% \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

% \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
%   menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%   also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%   available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.

% \item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
%   acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
%   \url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!gLfRVZbnI5EEpjSs2SUEUt3REx61nOcbbaUjq8m9DBea3vF6r9tqUdJHXlva$ }

% \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
%   "solid" shapes instead.

% \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
%   the equivalent AMS Fonts:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
% followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
% for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
% workaround for reals, natural and complex:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%    \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%    \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
% Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.

% \end{itemize}

% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
% you to fix it.

% \subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
% figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
% (\url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!gLfRVZbnI5EEpjSs2SUEUt3REx61nOcbbaUjq8m9DBea3vF6r9tqUZ5WNA5f$ })

% A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
% line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
% necessary.

% \begin{ack}
